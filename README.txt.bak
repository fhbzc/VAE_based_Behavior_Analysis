Declara: The code comes from a open-source project of Google(original link here https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/sketch_rnn)
I modify it to apply it in agents behaviors analysis

How to generate trainable data:

run GroupClassificationColor.py, it should generate 3 files: 
train_dataset.npz
valid_dataset.npz
test_dataset.npz

How to train the model:

run rnn_train.py, the trained variable should be stored in log folder in the same directory as rnn_train.py

How to get the classification image

run rnn_fetch.py, it should generate a file called out_put_array.npy in ./result foler
copy out_put_array.npy to ./T_SNE, in the same directory with the tsne.py
run tsne.py


	Let me if you have any problems implementing the network.
